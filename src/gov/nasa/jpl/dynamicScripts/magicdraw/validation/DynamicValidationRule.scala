/**
 * For now, this MagicDraw Validation Rule does nothing; it is intended to be the binary implementation
 * of MagicDraw Validation constraints that are used in Dynamic Scripts Validation. 
 * 
 * @todo Consider extending the Dynamic Scripts DSL with a "DynamicValidation" type
 * This "DynamicValidation" type would specify:
 * - a DynamicScript to be invoked for initializing & executing the validation
 * - a Constraint element that would be associated to a "DynamicValidation" 
 *
 * In MD's validation framework, the DynamicValidationRule's init() and run() methods 
 * are invoked with a validation Constraint which would serve as the key for a lookup of a "DynamicValidation" object
 * that would in turn specify the tool-specific methods to invoke (e.g., init() and run() in the case of MD).
 *
 * Before going further with this idea, check with Eclipse/Papyrus if there is enough commonality in the concept of
 * model validation such that the "DynamicValidation" type described above could fit the validation architecture
 * of both MD and Eclipse/Papyrus.
